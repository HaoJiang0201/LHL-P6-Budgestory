# Budgestory
Budgestory allows users to categorize their incomes and expenses. Categories can be created and sub categories can be nested within each other any number of times. Users can then navigate their finances by clicking on categories on a pie chart, which will render the subcategories of the chosen category. Each category will display the total value of all expenses of any category within that category. Users can view records by date and compare weeks and months to one another.
